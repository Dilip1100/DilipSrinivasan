                    A Health Company data also which is at any given point of time, has around 4000 employees. However, every year, around 15% of its employees leave the company and need to be replaced with the talent pool available in the job market.
                    The management believes that this level of attrition (employees leaving, either on their own or because they got fired) is bad for the company, because of the following reasons -
                    The former employees’ projects get delayed, which makes it difficult to meet timelines, resulting in a reputation loss among consumers and partners
                    A sizeable department has to be maintained, for the purposes of recruiting new talent
                    More often than not, the new employees have to be trained for the job and/or given time to fit themselves to the company
                    Hence, the management wants to understand what factors they should focus on, in order to curb attrition and how the employement numbers will impact them in 2020.
                    In other words, they want to know what changes they should make to their workplace, in order to get most of their employees to stay. Also, they want to know which of these variables is most important and needs to be addressed right away.
