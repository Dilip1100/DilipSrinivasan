                            The course give me an overview of the data, questions, and tools that data analysts and data scientists work with.
                            There were two components to this course. The first is a conceptual introduction to the ideas behind turning data into actionable knowledge.
                            The second was a practical introduction to the tools that will be used in the program like version control, markdown, git, GitHub, R, and RStudio.

                            data scientists and engineers. I was guided through the basics of using Hadoop with MapReduce, Spark, Pig and Hive.
                            I learnt how one can perform predictive modeling and leverage graph analytics to model problems.
                            I was able to ask the right questions about data, communicate effectively with data scientists, and do basic exploration of large,
                            complex datasets

                            This course provided a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition.
                            Topics included (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks)
                            (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning)
                            (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI)
                            The course will also drew from numerous case studies and applications, so I learnt how to apply learning algorithms
                            to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision,
                            medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.
